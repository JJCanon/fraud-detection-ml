# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a complete end-to-end pipeline for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle dataset **[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)**. 

## Project Scope
1. **ETL** → Data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and loading into a database.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Understanding patterns and visualizing trends.
3. **Machine Learning Models** → Training Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and a simple Neural Network for fraud detection.
4. **Evaluation** → Comparison of models using key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
5. **Dashboard (Power BI)** → Interactive visualization of fraud detection insights.
6. **Documentation** → Final report summarizing methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, tensorflow/pytorch)
- **SQLAlchemy** (ETL into database)
- **Power BI** (Dashboard and insights visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Experiments and documentation)
- **GitHub** (Version control and portfolio)

## Goal
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the application of data engineering and machine learning techniques to a real-world problem in the financial sector, while strengthening my portfolio with a well-documented and reproducible project.
